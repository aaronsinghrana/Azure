# 📊 Data Technician Bootcamp Projects

## 🔍 Overview
This repository summarises the projects and practical work completed during a **Data Technician bootcamp**. The bootcamp focused on building strong foundations in **data, cloud and Azure technologies**, supported by hands-on labs and scenario-based tasks.

Across the programme, I worked with **Azure, SQL, non-relational data and Microsoft Fabric** to design cloud solutions, analyse datasets and present insights in a clear and structured way. These projects demonstrate both technical understanding and the ability to apply learning to real-world style problems.

## 🧠 Key Skills and Technologies

### 🗄️ Introduction to Databases – Azure and SQL
- Designed and explored **relational databases** using Azure SQL  
- Wrote SQL queries to filter, sort and aggregate data  
- Used joins across multiple tables to answer business questions  
- Analysed customer, product and sales data  

**Outcome:** I produced meaningful insights from structured data, showing confidence with SQL queries and relational database concepts.
